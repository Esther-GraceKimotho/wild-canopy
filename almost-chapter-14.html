        <div class="story-text">
            <p>Time doesn’t heal everything. That’s the lie people like to tell because it sounds comforting. Time doesn’t fix what you don’t face. It doesn’t rewrite what already happened. It doesn’t magically return people to you, changed and ready. What time does is quieter than that. It gives you space. And in that space, you either grow into someone new or keep orbiting an old memory.</p>

            <p>Months passed. Not dramatically. Not in a way that marked itself with major events. Just slowly, the way semesters do—measured in assignments, group discussions, late-night studying, and the changing weather. Elena found a new rhythm. Her days became fuller. She joined a small study group. Started running in the evenings with a friend from her constitutional law class. Began volunteering at a legal aid clinic on Saturdays. Her life no longer had a visible empty space shaped like Adrian. But sometimes, in quieter moments, she still thought about him. Not with the same sharp ache. Just a soft, familiar echo.</p>

            <p>One afternoon, nearly four months after their conversation at the chess table, she saw him again. Not from across a crowded hallway. Not in passing. But close. He was standing near the campus café, waiting for his order. One hand in his pocket. The other scrolling absently through his phone. For a second, she considered turning around. Avoidance was easy. Clean. Predictable. But something inside her had changed. She didn’t feel fragile anymore. So she walked forward.</p>
            
            <p>“Hey, Adrian.”</p>
            
            <p>He looked up. Surprise crossed his face first. Then something softer. “Elena. Hey.”</p>
            
            <p>There was a short pause, the kind that used to feel unbearable. Now, it just felt… neutral.</p>
            
            <p>“How have you been?” he asked.</p>
            
            <p>“Good,” she said honestly. “Busy. You?”</p>
            
            <p>“Same. Engineering never relaxes.”</p>
            
            <p>She smiled faintly. “I figured.”</p>
            
            <p>They stood there, two people who once knew the details of each other’s days, now exchanging careful, surface-level sentences. It wasn’t painful. Just unfamiliar.</p>

            <p>He cleared his throat slightly. “I’ve seen you around,” he said. “You look… different.”</p>
            
            <p>“Different how?”</p>
            
            <p>“Lighter,” he admitted. “More… settled.”</p>
            
            <p>The words surprised her. She hadn’t realized it was visible. “Maybe I am,” she said.</p>
            
            <p>He nodded slowly, as if confirming something to himself. “I’m glad.” And she believed him.</p>

            <p>A barista called his name. “That’s me,” he said, stepping forward to collect his drink. When he returned, he hesitated. “Can I ask you something?” he said.</p>
            
            <p>“Sure.”</p>
            
            <p>“Do you ever regret it? Us, I mean.”</p>
            
            <p>She considered the question carefully. The old version of her would have answered from pain. This version answered from clarity. “No,” she said. “I don’t regret it.”</p>
            
            <p>He looked relieved, but also a little curious. “Why not?”</p>
            
            <p>“Because it taught me what I actually need,” she said. “Not just what I’m willing to accept.”</p>
            
            <p>He absorbed that quietly. “And… do you ever think about trying again?” he asked.</p>
            
            <p>The question hung in the air between them. Not desperate. Not manipulative. Just honest. She studied his face. He looked a little more tired than before. A little more serious. Like someone who had done some thinking. But she didn’t rush her answer.</p>
            
            <p>“Sometimes,” she admitted. “But not in the same way.”</p>
            
            <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
            
            <p>“I don’t think about getting back what we had,” she said. “I think about whether we could build something different. Something more certain.”</p>
            
            <p>He nodded slowly. “That makes sense.”</p>

            <p>They stood there for another moment. No tension. No urgency. Just two people who once almost loved each other.</p>
            
            <p>“Well,” she said, adjusting her bag, “I have a tutorial in ten minutes.”</p>
            
            <p>“Right. Of course.”</p>
            
            <p>She hesitated. “Take care, Adrian.”</p>
            
            <p>“You too, Elena.”</p>
            
            <p>This time, the words didn’t feel like an ending. They felt like a checkpoint.</p>

            <p>As she walked away, she noticed something subtle. Her heart wasn’t racing. Her thoughts weren’t spiraling. She wasn’t replaying every word. She just felt… calm.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">Seeing him again didn’t break me. It didn’t pull me back into the past. It didn’t make me question my growth. It just reminded me of something simple: We were real. We mattered. We just weren’t ready at the same time. And sometimes, the distance between then and now is where people become who they needed to be all along. The question isn’t whether the past can return. The question is: If it does, will it recognize the people we’ve become?</p>
