        <p class="book-title">The Argument That Meant Something</p>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>The fight didn’t begin with shouting. It began with a sentence that felt small at first.</p>
            
            <p>“I might take the internship in Mombasa,” Elena said, almost casually, as they sat at the café near campus.</p>
            
            <p>Adrian looked up from his coffee. “For how long?”</p>
            
            <p>“Six months. Maybe more, depending on the extension.”</p>
            
            <p>He blinked. “You applied for that?”</p>
            
            <p>“Yeah. A while ago.”</p>
            
            <p>A small pause settled between them. “You didn’t tell me,” he said.</p>
            
            <p>Her eyebrows lifted slightly. “It wasn’t confirmed yet.”</p>
            
            <p>“That’s not the point.”</p>
            
            <p>She leaned back. “Then what is the point?”</p>

            <p>He hadn’t expected the irritation that rose in his chest. “I just feel like I should’ve known,” he said. “Six months isn’t small.”</p>
            
            <p>She crossed her arms lightly. “It’s my career, Adrian. I can’t pause opportunities just because we’re together.”</p>
            
            <p>“I’m not saying that.”</p>
            
            <p>“It sounds like you are.”</p>
            
            <p>His jaw tightened. “I just thought… I thought we were building something here.”</p>
            
            <p>Her eyes softened, but her voice remained steady. “We are. But that doesn’t mean everything else stops.”</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">This is the moment relationships are tested. Not by distance. But by what distance represents. Fear. Uncertainty. The possibility that love might not be enough.</p>

            <p>“I’m not asking you to stay,” he said, quieter now. “I just… I wish you’d told me earlier.”</p>
            
            <p>She studied his face. “You’re not upset about the internship,” she said slowly. “You’re upset about what it might mean for us.”</p>
            
            <p>He didn’t answer. Because she was right.</p>

            <p>They walked out of the café in silence. Not the peaceful kind. The heavy kind. The kind where every step feels like it’s carrying unsaid words. At the corner near the bus stop, she stopped walking.</p>
            
            <p>“Say it,” she said.</p>
            
            <p>“Say what?”</p>
            
            <p>“What you’re actually afraid of.”</p>
            
            <p>He hesitated. “I’m afraid,” he admitted, “that this is how things fall apart. Not dramatically. Just… slowly. Distance. Busy schedules. Fewer calls. And then one day we’re just two people who used to matter to each other.”</p>
            
            <p>Her chest tightened at the honesty. “And you think I’d let that happen?”</p>
            
            <p>“I don’t know,” he said. “I didn’t think I’d pull away from you before either. But I did.”</p>
            
            <p>The vulnerability in his voice made her step closer. “This isn’t the same thing,” she said gently. “This isn’t fear. This is growth. This is opportunity.”</p>
            
            <p>“And where do I fit into that?” he asked quietly.</p>

            <p>The question hung between them. Not accusatory. Just painfully honest.</p>
            
            <p>“You fit into my life,” she said. “But not as the reason I shrink it.”</p>
            
            <p>He nodded slowly. The words hurt. But they also made sense.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">Love shouldn’t be a cage. Not even a beautiful one. If I have to choose between my future and the person I love, then something about that love isn’t right.</p>

            <p>“I don’t want you to stay back for me,” he said finally.</p>
            
            <p>“Then what do you want?”</p>
            
            <p>He searched for the answer. And for the first time, he didn’t reach for something safe. “I want to matter in your future,” he said. “Not just your present.”</p>
            
            <p>Her expression softened. “You do,” she said. “But the future isn’t one big decision. It’s a thousand small ones. And this is just one of them.”</p>

            <p>They stood there, caught between fear and understanding. Between love and independence. Between what they had and what they might become.</p>
            
            <p>“Are you scared?” he asked.</p>
            
            <p>“Of the internship?”</p>
            
            <p>“Of us.”</p>
            
            <p>She exhaled slowly. “Yes,” she admitted. “But not in the way you think.”</p>
            
            <p>He waited.</p>
            
            <p>“I’m scared of choosing a life where I stop growing just to keep love comfortable,” she said. “Because that version of me would eventually resent you.”</p>
            
            <p>The honesty hit him harder than any accusation could have. Because he knew she was right.</p>

            <p>They didn’t hug when they parted. No dramatic goodbye. Just a quiet, complicated distance between them.</p>

            <p>That night, Adrian lay awake in his room. The ceiling looked the same. The walls looked the same. But something inside him felt different. For the first time, the thought of losing her didn’t just feel sad. It felt unbearable. Not because he needed her to stay. But because he suddenly understood something simple and terrifying: He didn’t just want her in his life. He wanted a life with her. And that life had to include her growth. Her risks. Her choices. Even the ones that took her far away from him.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">I used to think love was about proximity. About seeing someone every day. Talking constantly. Never feeling distance. But maybe love is this— Wanting someone’s future to be big, even if you’re not sure where you’ll stand inside it. And if that’s true, then I don’t just like her. I don’t just care about her. I love her. And for the first time in my life, the idea of a future automatically includes someone else.</p>
