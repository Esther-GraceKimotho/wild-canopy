        <p class="book-title">The First Real Day</p>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>The next morning didn’t feel cinematic. No sunrise epiphanies. No grand declarations. Just sunlight slipping through the curtains and the soft vibration of Elena’s phone on her bedside table. She reached for it, still half-asleep.</p>
            
            <p><em>Adrian: Good morning. Hope you slept okay.</em></p>
            
            <p>She stared at the message longer than necessary. It was simple. Ordinary. But it felt different from the messages he used to send. No hesitation. No emotional distance wrapped in casual words. Just presence. She typed back:</p>
            
            <p><em>Elena: Morning. I did. You?</em></p>
            
            <p>The three dots appeared almost immediately.</p>
            
            <p><em>Adrian: Better than usual.</em></p>
            
            <p>A small smile touched her lips before she could stop it.</p>

            <p>Later that afternoon, they met on campus. Not at the chess table. Not in the café. Just walking side by side between lecture halls. It felt strangely new. Like meeting someone familiar in a different light. </p>
            
            <p>“So,” he said, hands tucked into his pockets, “does this count as the first official day of trying?”</p>
            
            <p>She raised an eyebrow. “You’re keeping track already?”</p>
            
            <p>“I just don’t want to mess it up by pretending nothing changed.”</p>
            
            <p>She considered that. “That’s… surprisingly mature of you.”</p>
            
            <p>He glanced at her. “Surprisingly?”</p>
            
            <p>She shrugged. “You set the bar low before.”</p>
            
            <p>He winced slightly. “Fair.”</p>

            <p>They stopped near a shaded bench beneath a tall tree. Students passed around them, lost in their own conversations, their own stories. “So what does trying actually look like today?” he asked. Elena sat down. “Today?” she repeated. “Yeah. Not in theory. In real life.” </p>
            
            <p>She thought for a moment. “Today looks like honesty,” she said. “No pretending you’re fine when you’re not. No disappearing because something feels intense.”</p>
            
            <p>He nodded slowly. “Okay. Then I’ll start.” She turned toward him. “I’m nervous,” he admitted. “Not about you. About myself. About whether I can actually be as consistent as I said I’d be.”</p>
            
            <p>She studied his face. “That’s honest,” she said. “And honesty is a better starting point than confidence you don’t actually feel.”</p>
            
            <p>He let out a small breath. “Your turn,” he said.</p>
            
            <p>She hesitated. “Part of me is waiting for you to pull away again,” she admitted. “Even though I said yes. Even though I meant it.”</p>
            
            <p>He didn’t look offended. He just nodded. “That makes sense,” he said quietly.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">Trying again isn’t romantic. It’s awkward. Careful. Measured. You don’t run toward each other. You walk. Slowly. Watching for the places where things once cracked. And maybe that’s what makes it real. Not the butterflies. Not the rush. But the quiet decision to stay when the moment is ordinary.</p>

            <p>He leaned back slightly against the bench. “So what helps with that?” he asked. “The part of you that’s waiting for me to disappear.”</p>
            
            <p>She considered the question. “Consistency,” she said. “Small things. Not big speeches.”</p>
            
            <p>“Like good morning texts?”</p>
            
            <p>She smiled faintly. “Exactly like that.”</p>
            
            <p>“Okay,” he said. “I can do small things.”</p>
            
            <p>She looked at him. “Small things are usually the big things in disguise.”</p>

            <p>They sat in comfortable silence for a moment. Not the tense silence from before. Just the kind that happens when two people are thinking at the same time. “Do you ever feel like we skipped the easy part?” he asked.</p>
            
            <p>“What easy part?”</p>
            
            <p>“The part where everything is light and uncomplicated.”</p>
            
            <p>She laughed softly. “I don’t think that part exists the way people imagine it.”</p>
            
            <p>He tilted his head. “You don’t?”</p>
            
            <p>“No,” she said. “I think even the easy parts are built on things people don’t talk about. Fear. Expectations. Timing. We just didn’t hide ours.”</p>
            
            <p>He considered that. “So we started with the complicated part?”</p>
            
            <p>“Maybe,” she said. “But that might make the simple parts feel more honest.”</p>

            <p>He stood up and offered his hand. “Walk with me?” he asked. She looked at his hand for a second. Then took it. Not dramatically. Not like a scene in a movie. Just a quiet, intentional gesture. They began walking again, side by side.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">This doesn’t feel like falling. It feels like choosing. And maybe that’s better. Falling is fast. Uncontrolled. Beautiful, but reckless. Choosing is slower. But it has roots. And roots last longer than wings ever could.</p>

            <p>As they reached the end of the pathway, he glanced at her. “Same time tomorrow?” he asked.</p>
            
            <p>She smiled. “Let’s not turn this into a schedule.”</p>
            
            <p>He laughed. “Right. Too soon.” She squeezed his hand lightly before letting go. “Just… show up,” she said. “That’s enough for now.”</p>
            
            <p>He nodded. “I will.” And this time, the promise didn’t feel fragile. It felt like a beginning that was learning how to walk before it tried to run.</p>
