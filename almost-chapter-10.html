        <p class="book-title">The Things He Never Said</p>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>Adrian knew the exact moment things shifted. It wasn’t when she asked, “Are we okay?” It wasn’t when she matched his delayed replies. It wasn’t even when she looked at him in the rain and asked if he still wanted this. It was earlier. The first time he realized she was starting to fall.</p>

            <p>He had noticed the way she arrived five minutes early. The way she pretended not to wait for him. The way her face lit up when he said something clever. He noticed everything. He just didn’t say it. There was something terrifying about being seen the way she saw him. Not casually. Not playfully. But intentionally. As if she were studying him the way she studied the chessboard— carefully, patiently, searching for patterns. He wasn’t used to that.</p>

            <p>He had liked her from the beginning. That was never the issue. He liked the way she overexplained things when she was nervous. He liked that she challenged him instead of agreeing too quickly. He liked that she felt things deeply and didn’t pretend otherwise. But liking someone and being ready for them are not the same thing.</p>

            <p>The first time he replied late on purpose, he told himself it was nothing. He had assignments. He had responsibilities. He had other parts of his life demanding attention. But beneath all of that was something smaller and more honest: He was scared of how quickly she was becoming important. When she texted, his mood shifted. When she was quiet, he noticed. When she laughed, he replayed it later. That kind of influence felt dangerous.</p>

            <p>He had been in something before. Not dramatic. Not catastrophic. Just intense enough to teach him that emotional dependence could become suffocating. He remembered the feeling of losing himself inside someone else’s expectations. He promised himself he wouldn’t do that again. And then Elena arrived, not demanding, not possessive, but present. Consistently present. And that frightened him more than chaos ever could.</p>

            <p>When she started pulling back, he felt it immediately. The shorter replies. The absence of long stories. The way she stopped arriving early. He noticed. He just didn’t know how to respond without accelerating something he wasn’t ready to define. When he texted, “You’ve been distant,” it wasn’t an accusation. It was fear. Fear that she was slipping away. Fear that he might lose her before he figured out what he wanted. But when she replied, “Just busy,” he felt relief. Relief meant safety. Safety meant nothing had to change.</p>

            <p>The night she asked, “Do you still want this?” his chest tightened before she even finished the sentence. He did want her. But wanting her meant choosing her. And choosing her meant stepping into something real. Something visible. Something that could end in a way that would hurt far more than this quiet in-between. He wasn’t unsure about her. He was unsure about himself. About whether he could show up consistently. About whether he could be enough. About whether he would eventually feel trapped and pull away worse than he was now. So he hesitated. And hesitation, he was beginning to understand, looked exactly like rejection from the outside.</p>

            <p>When she said, “I feel like I’m always leaning forward,” he felt it land. Because she was right. He had been stepping back. Not because he didn’t care. But because he cared enough to know he might not sustain it. There’s a particular kind of guilt in knowing someone is offering you something steady and you’re responding with caution. She thought he was protecting himself from her. In truth, he was protecting her from the version of himself that wasn’t ready. He admired her clarity. He envied it. She knew what she wanted: Consistency. Certainty. Reciprocity. He wanted those things too. He just didn’t trust himself to maintain them. He feared becoming the villain in a story he never meant to ruin.</p>

            <p>That night, after the rain, he stared at his phone. He typed: <span style="font-style: italic;">I’m trying.</span> Deleted it. He typed: <span style="font-style: italic;">I don’t want to lose you.</span> Deleted that too. Because wanting and doing are not equal. And he wasn’t sure he could promise to do. So he said nothing. And silence, he realized too late, is rarely neutral.</p>

            <p>In his room, alone, he admitted something he hadn’t allowed himself to articulate: If she walked away, it would hurt. More than he expected. More than he had prepared for. But if she stayed, he would eventually have to confront the fear he kept postponing. And he didn’t know which outcome scared him more.</p>

            <p>He lay awake longer than usual. Not because he didn’t care. But because he cared and didn’t know how to hold that care without retreating from it. Some people run because they feel nothing. Others run because they feel too much and don’t trust themselves not to ruin it. He didn’t know which one he was. He only knew this: She was ready to step forward. And he was still standing at the edge.</p>
