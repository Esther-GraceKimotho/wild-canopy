        <p class="book-title">Gentle, But Not Enough</p>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>He didn’t leave in one dramatic moment. There was no slammed door. No angry speech. No betrayal big enough to justify heartbreak. If anything, he was gentle. That was the problem. It’s easier to hate someone who hurts you loudly. It’s harder to let go of someone who leaves quietly, kindly, almost apologetically. Because then you start wondering: Maybe it wasn’t that bad. Maybe I should have held on a little longer. Maybe I just needed to be more patient.</p>

            <p>The rain started earlier than expected that afternoon. A soft, steady drizzle that turned the courtyard tiles dark and glossy. Students rushed between buildings, backpacks over their heads, laughter and complaints mixing in the damp air. Elena stood under the overhang near the chess table, watching the rain gather in shallow puddles. He was late again. Not terribly late. Just enough for her to notice. She checked her phone. No message. She told herself not to read into it. A few minutes later, he appeared from the far side of the courtyard, jogging lightly to avoid the heavier patches of rain. His hair was slightly damp, and he wiped his hands on his jeans as he approached.</p>
            
            <p>“Sorry,” he said, a little breathless. “Caught in a meeting.”</p>
            
            <p>“It’s okay.” She meant it. Or at least, she wanted to.</p>
            
            <p>They sat down, the chessboard between them, the sound of rain filling the spaces where their conversation used to live. He seemed calmer today. Less distracted. But also… less present. Like someone who had already started packing their things in their mind.</p>
            
            <p>“You’ve been quiet lately,” she said, moving her knight.</p>
            
            <p>He didn’t look up immediately. “Have I?”</p>
            
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            
            <p>He considered that. “Just a lot going on.”</p>
            
            <p>She waited for more. Nothing came. “What kind of stuff?” she asked gently.</p>
            
            <p>He sighed, not in annoyance, but in a way that sounded tired. “Family things. School. Just… life.”</p>
            
            <p>She nodded slowly. “I get that.” And she did. Life was heavy sometimes. People had their own battles. But a small part of her wished he would open the door a little wider. Let her in.</p>
            
            <p>“Sorry if I’ve been distant,” he added. “It’s not intentional.” The words were soft. Careful. Gentle. Her chest warmed slightly.</p>
            
            <p>“It’s okay,” she said. “I just thought maybe I’d done something wrong.”</p>
            
            <p>He looked up quickly. “No. You didn’t.” The answer came too fast, too certain. For a moment, she felt relieved. Then the unease returned. Because if she hadn’t done anything wrong… then the distance wasn’t something she could fix.</p>

            <p>They played in silence for a while. Rain tapped steadily against the roof above them. The air smelled like wet soil and leaves. He captured one of her pieces.</p>
            
            <p>“Careful,” he said, a small smile forming. “You’re getting reckless.”</p>
            
            <p>“I thought you liked it when I took risks.”</p>
            
            <p>He chuckled softly. “On the board, maybe.”</p>
            
            <p>She raised an eyebrow. “And off the board?”</p>
            
            <p>He hesitated. Just for a second. But she noticed. “I think… people should protect themselves a little,” he said. “Not give everything away too fast.”</p>
            
            <p>The words settled between them. Not harsh. Not accusatory. Just… thoughtful. But they landed like a quiet warning. She swallowed.</p>
            
            <p>“Is that what you think I’m doing?” she asked.</p>
            
            <p>He looked at her, then at the board. “I don’t know,” he said. “Maybe.”</p>
            
            <p>The answer wasn’t cruel. It was honest. And somehow, that hurt more.</p>

            <p>That evening, she walked back to her hostel slowly, letting the damp air cool her thoughts. His words echoed in her mind. <em>People should protect themselves. Not give everything away too fast.</em> Had she been too open? Too warm? Too easy to read? She thought about every message she had sent. Every laugh. Every time she had stayed longer at the table just to keep talking. Maybe he was right. Maybe she had given too much of herself to something that hadn’t even been defined.</p>
            
            <p>Her phone buzzed in her hand.</p>
            
            <p><em>Adrian: Did you get back okay?</em></p>
            
            <p>Her heart softened immediately.</p>
            
            <p><em>Elena: Yeah. Just reached.</em></p>
            
            <p>Three dots appeared.</p>
            
            <p><em>Adrian: Good.</em></p>
            
            <p>She waited. Nothing else came. No joke. No question. No “talk later.” Just <em>good</em>. She locked her phone. The conversation felt like a door that had been opened halfway—and then gently pushed shut again.</p>

            <p>The next few days followed the same pattern. He was kind. He was polite. He still showed up. But something was missing. The easy laughter. The long conversations. The feeling that time stretched when they were together. Now, their games felt shorter. Their words more careful.</p>
            
            <p>One afternoon, as they packed up the chessboard, she said quietly: “Do you ever feel like something’s changed?”</p>
            
            <p>He paused. “Between us?”</p>
            
            <p>She nodded.</p>
            
            <p>He took a moment before answering. “Maybe.”</p>
            
            <p>Her stomach tightened. “Is that a bad thing?” she asked.</p>
            
            <p>He shrugged lightly. “Not necessarily. Things change. It’s normal.”</p>
            
            <p><em>Normal.</em> The word felt heavy in her chest. “Do you still like spending time with me?” she asked, before she could stop herself.</p>
            
            <p>He looked at her, surprised by the directness. “Of course I do,” he said gently. “You’re easy to talk to. And you’re improving at chess.”</p>
            
            <p>She forced a small smile. “That sounds like a compliment.”</p>
            
            <p>“It is.”</p>
            
            <p>But something about it felt… incomplete. Like a sentence that was missing its second half.</p>

            <p>That night, she lay awake, staring at the ceiling. He still liked her company. He still cared enough to ask if she got back safely. He still sat across from her every afternoon. Nothing was broken. And yet, everything felt different. It was like holding water in her hands. Still there. Still real. But slowly slipping through her fingers, no matter how gently she tried to hold it.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">He never said anything cruel. He never pushed me away harshly. Never told me I was too much. Never made me feel unwanted. He was just… careful. Gentle. Distant. Uncertain. And somehow, that hurt more than a clean ending would have. Because as long as he was still there, still kind, still replying… A part of me kept hoping that the warmth would come back.</p>
