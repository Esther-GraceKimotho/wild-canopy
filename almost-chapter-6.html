        <p class="book-title">The First Time I Was Afraid</p>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>The first time I felt afraid of losing him, nothing had actually happened. That&rsquo;s what makes it embarrassing. He hadn&rsquo;t said goodbye. He hadn&rsquo;t withdrawn completely. He hadn&rsquo;t even been unkind. He had just&#8230; shifted. And I felt it in my body before I understood it in my mind. There is a particular kind of fear that doesn&rsquo;t scream. It whispers. It says: Pay attention. Something is moving. You are no longer standing on solid ground.</p>

            <p>Elena told herself she was overreacting. It had been less than two months. Less than two months of chess games, shared snacks, small jokes, and evenings that stretched longer than they should have. Less than two months of routine. That wasn&rsquo;t long enough to build something fragile. And yet, when she approached the table that afternoon and found him already there&mdash;but unusually quiet&mdash;something inside her tightened. He didn&rsquo;t look up immediately when she sat down. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; His voice was normal. Calm. Controlled. But his eyes stayed on his phone for a second longer than usual before he placed it face down on the table. She noticed. She noticed everything now. &ldquo;You started without me?&rdquo; she asked, nodding toward the board. &ldquo;Just setting it up.&rdquo; He slid it toward her. &ldquo;White.&rdquo; She moved a pawn forward, trying to settle into the familiar rhythm. Usually, he would comment. Tease her about playing it safe. Predict her next move. Today, he simply responded. They played in near silence for several minutes. Around them, the courtyard hummed with life. Laughter. Footsteps. The distant sound of music from someone&rsquo;s speaker. But at their table, something felt suspended. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quiet,&rdquo; she said finally. He shrugged slightly. &ldquo;Just thinking.&rdquo; &ldquo;About?&rdquo; &ldquo;Stuff.&rdquo; She waited. He didn&rsquo;t elaborate. A small, sharp discomfort flickered in her chest. Stuff. She had always told him about her &ldquo;stuff.&rdquo; Annoying lectures. A confusing assignment. A disagreement with a classmate. He would listen. Sometimes offer advice. Sometimes just nod and let her talk. Now he had &ldquo;stuff,&rdquo; and she was outside of it. She moved her bishop without fully thinking. He captured it immediately. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not paying attention,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not.&rdquo; There was no accusation in his voice. Just observation. She swallowed. &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m thinking too.&rdquo; He met her eyes then, properly. &ldquo;About?&rdquo; The word landed heavier than she expected. She could say it. About you. About why you feel different. About whether I imagined all of this. Instead, she looked down at the board. &ldquo;Stuff.&rdquo; Something flickered across his face&mdash;almost amusement. &ldquo;Fair.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>That evening, she sent him a message first. It was small. You forgot your water bottle. It wasn&rsquo;t even true. He hadn&rsquo;t. But she needed a reason. He replied twenty minutes later. I didn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s in my bag. She stared at the message. Of course it was. Oh. My bad. Five minutes passed. Ten. She watched the screen, waiting for something more. A joke. A follow-up question. Anything. Nothing came. She placed her phone face down and leaned back against her bed, staring at the ceiling. Why did she need more? He had answered. The conversation had ended naturally. That&rsquo;s what she told herself. Still, the silence felt heavier than it used to.</p>

            <p>Over the next few days, she began measuring things she had never measured before. How long it took him to reply. How often he checked his phone when they were together. Whether he smiled first, or she did. One afternoon, she decided she wouldn&rsquo;t message him at all. Not after lectures. Not in the evening. Not even a casual meme or comment about campus life. If he wanted to talk, he would. She lasted until 9:47 p.m. Then her phone lit up. Her heart jumped before she could stop it. Adrian: You disappeared today. She stared at the message. Disappeared. As if she were the one creating distance. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard. I was busy. Delete. I thought you were. Delete. You seemed distracted. Delete. She forced herself to type something simple. Elena: Just studying. The typing indicator appeared almost instantly. Adrian: You could&rsquo;ve said bye at least. Her stomach twisted. She replayed the afternoon in her mind. She had left the table after he checked his phone twice in the span of five minutes. &ldquo;I have to go,&rdquo; she had said. &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he had replied, eyes still on the screen. She hadn&rsquo;t thought she needed to say more. Now, suddenly, it felt like she had committed a small crime. Sorry, she typed. Then paused. Why was she apologizing? She erased it. Elena: You were busy. Three dots. They disappeared. Reappeared. Disappeared again. Finally: Adrian: Not too busy for you. Her breath caught. There it was. A sentence that felt warm. Reassuring. And yet, it didn&rsquo;t completely undo the unease. Because if he wasn&rsquo;t too busy for her, why did it feel like she was fighting for space inside his day?</p>

            <p>The fear became clearer the following week. They were sitting at the table when his phone buzzed repeatedly. He glanced at it, then smiled faintly. Not at her. At the screen. She told herself not to react. He typed quickly, thumbs moving with ease. &ldquo;You can answer,&rdquo; she said lightly. &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; The words were simple. Matter-of-fact. Not defensive. Not apologetic. Just honest. She nodded. He finished typing and set the phone down again. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he added, almost as an afterthought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; And it was. It should have been. But something inside her whispered: You&rsquo;re not the only one he laughs with. You&rsquo;re not the only one he texts like that. You&rsquo;re not as central as you thought. The realization wasn&rsquo;t dramatic. It was quiet. And that&rsquo;s what made it dangerous.</p>

            <p>That night, she didn&rsquo;t sleep easily. She replayed every interaction from the past few weeks, searching for proof that she was imagining things. Maybe this was normal. Maybe this was just what happened when two people got comfortable. Maybe the intensity of the beginning was bound to settle. But beneath all the rational explanations was a simpler truth she didn&rsquo;t want to admit: She had fallen. Not dramatically. Not recklessly. But undeniably. And now she was afraid. Afraid that she had stepped further in than he ever intended to. Afraid that what felt like the beginning of something meaningful to her was, to him, just a pleasant phase.</p>

            <p>The next afternoon, she arrived early. The chess table was empty. She sat down and waited. Five minutes. Ten. Her phone buzzed. Adrian: Running late. She stared at the message. Two words. No explanation. Her chest tightened. It&rsquo;s fine, she typed. Then deleted it. She waited another few seconds. Then: Okay. She placed her phone down and looked at the empty chair across from her. For the first time since they met, she imagined the possibility that one day he simply wouldn&rsquo;t show up. No message. No explanation. Just absence. And the thought scared her more than she wanted to admit.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">I didn&rsquo;t lose him that week. He still came. He still played. He still replied. Nothing had officially changed. But I felt the shift. And once you feel it, you can&rsquo;t un-feel it. That was the first time I realized something dangerous: You can start grieving someone long before they&rsquo;re actually gone.</p>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>He didn’t leave in one dramatic moment. There was no slammed door. No angry speech. No betrayal big enough to justify heartbreak. If anything, he was gentle. That was the problem. It’s easier to hate someone who hurts you loudly. It’s harder to let go of someone who leaves quietly, kindly, almost apologetically. Because then you start wondering: Maybe it wasn’t that bad. Maybe I should have held on a little longer. Maybe I just needed to be more patient.</p>

            <p>The rain started earlier than expected that afternoon. A soft, steady drizzle that turned the courtyard tiles dark and glossy. Students rushed between buildings, backpacks over their heads, laughter and complaints mixing in the damp air. Elena stood under the overhang near the chess table, watching the rain gather in shallow puddles. He was late again. Not terribly late. Just enough for her to notice. She checked her phone. No message. She told herself not to read into it. A few minutes later, he appeared from the far side of the courtyard, jogging lightly to avoid the heavier patches of rain. His hair was slightly damp, and he wiped his hands on his jeans as he approached.</p>
            
            <p>“Sorry,” he said, a little breathless. “Caught in a meeting.”</p>
            
            <p>“It’s okay.” She meant it. Or at least, she wanted to.</p>
            
            <p>They sat down, the chessboard between them, the sound of rain filling the spaces where their conversation used to live. He seemed calmer today. Less distracted. But also… less present. Like someone who had already started packing their things in their mind.</p>
            
            <p>“You’ve been quiet lately,” she said, moving her knight.</p>
            
            <p>He didn’t look up immediately. “Have I?”</p>
            
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            
            <p>He considered that. “Just a lot going on.”</p>
            
            <p>She waited for more. Nothing came. “What kind of stuff?” she asked gently.</p>
            
            <p>He sighed, not in annoyance, but in a way that sounded tired. “Family things. School. Just… life.”</p>
            
            <p>She nodded slowly. “I get that.” And she did. Life was heavy sometimes. People had their own battles. But a small part of her wished he would open the door a little wider. Let her in.</p>
            
            <p>“Sorry if I’ve been distant,” he added. “It’s not intentional.” The words were soft. Careful. Gentle. Her chest warmed slightly.</p>
            
            <p>“It’s okay,” she said. “I just thought maybe I’d done something wrong.”</p>
            
            <p>He looked up quickly. “No. You didn’t.” The answer came too fast, too certain. For a moment, she felt relieved. Then the unease returned. Because if she hadn’t done anything wrong… then the distance wasn’t something she could fix.</p>

            <p>They played in silence for a while. Rain tapped steadily against the roof above them. The air smelled like wet soil and leaves. He captured one of her pieces.</p>
            
            <p>“Careful,” he said, a small smile forming. “You’re getting reckless.”</p>
            
            <p>“I thought you liked it when I took risks.”</p>
            
            <p>He chuckled softly. “On the board, maybe.”</p>
            
            <p>She raised an eyebrow. “And off the board?”</p>
            
            <p>He hesitated. Just for a second. But she noticed. “I think… people should protect themselves a little,” he said. “Not give everything away too fast.”</p>
            
            <p>The words settled between them. Not harsh. Not accusatory. Just… thoughtful. But they landed like a quiet warning. She swallowed.</p>
            
            <p>“Is that what you think I’m doing?” she asked.</p>
            
            <p>He looked at her, then at the board. “I don’t know,” he said. “Maybe.”</p>
            
            <p>The answer wasn’t cruel. It was honest. And somehow, that hurt more.</p>

            <p>That evening, she walked back to her hostel slowly, letting the damp air cool her thoughts. His words echoed in her mind. <em>People should protect themselves. Not give everything away too fast.</em> Had she been too open? Too warm? Too easy to read? She thought about every message she had sent. Every laugh. Every time she had stayed longer at the table just to keep talking. Maybe he was right. Maybe she had given too much of herself to something that hadn’t even been defined.</p>
            
            <p>Her phone buzzed in her hand.</p>
            
            <p><em>Adrian: Did you get back okay?</em></p>
            
            <p>Her heart softened immediately.</p>
            
            <p><em>Elena: Yeah. Just reached.</em></p>
            
            <p>Three dots appeared.</p>
            
            <p><em>Adrian: Good.</em></p>
            
            <p>She waited. Nothing else came. No joke. No question. No “talk later.” Just <em>good</em>. She locked her phone. The conversation felt like a door that had been opened halfway—and then gently pushed shut again.</p>

            <p>The next few days followed the same pattern. He was kind. He was polite. He still showed up. But something was missing. The easy laughter. The long conversations. The feeling that time stretched when they were together. Now, their games felt shorter. Their words more careful.</p>
            
            <p>One afternoon, as they packed up the chessboard, she said quietly: “Do you ever feel like something’s changed?”</p>
            
            <p>He paused. “Between us?”</p>
            
            <p>She nodded.</p>
            
            <p>He took a moment before answering. “Maybe.”</p>
            
            <p>Her stomach tightened. “Is that a bad thing?” she asked.</p>
            
            <p>He shrugged lightly. “Not necessarily. Things change. It’s normal.”</p>
            
            <p><em>Normal.</em> The word felt heavy in her chest. “Do you still like spending time with me?” she asked, before she could stop herself.</p>
            
            <p>He looked at her, surprised by the directness. “Of course I do,” he said gently. “You’re easy to talk to. And you’re improving at chess.”</p>
            
            <p>She forced a small smile. “That sounds like a compliment.”</p>
            
            <p>“It is.”</p>
            
            <p>But something about it felt… incomplete. Like a sentence that was missing its second half.</p>

            <p>That night, she lay awake, staring at the ceiling. He still liked her company. He still cared enough to ask if she got back safely. He still sat across from her every afternoon. Nothing was broken. And yet, everything felt different. It was like holding water in her hands. Still there. Still real. But slowly slipping through her fingers, no matter how gently she tried to hold it.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">He never said anything cruel. He never pushed me away harshly. Never told me I was too much. Never made me feel unwanted. He was just… careful. Gentle. Distant. Uncertain. And somehow, that hurt more than a clean ending would have. Because as long as he was still there, still kind, still replying… A part of me kept hoping that the warmth would come back.</p>
