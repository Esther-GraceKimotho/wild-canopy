        <div class="story-text">
            <p class="reflection">There’s a quiet shift that happens before you realize you’re falling. It doesn’t arrive with a confession or a touch. It arrives with routine. The first time you expect them to be there. The first time you look for them without meaning to. The first time a place feels incomplete without their presence in it. You don’t call it love. You call it a habit. You call it comfort. You call it a coincidence. Anything but what it really is.</p>
            <p>By the end of the second week, the chess table no longer felt like a coincidence. It felt like a meeting point. Elena began to time her walks across the courtyard without admitting it to herself. If her lecture ended early, she would slow down near the library steps. If it ended late, she would still pass by the jacaranda tree, just in case.</p>
            <p>Some days Adrian was already there. Other days he arrived a few minutes after her, carrying a worn notebook under his arm and a pen tucked behind his ear. Neither of them ever said, “Let’s meet at this time.” But they kept showing up anyway.</p>
            <p>That afternoon, Elena reached the table to find the board already set up. Adrian was leaning back in his chair, watching the branches of the jacaranda sway gently above them. “You’re early,” he said when he saw her.</p>
            <p>She frowned. “You say that every time.”</p>
            <p>“Because it’s always true.”</p>
            <p>She dropped her bag onto the bench beside her and sat down. “Maybe I just like beating you here.”</p>
            <p>He raised an eyebrow. “You haven’t beaten me at anything yet.”</p>
            <p>She ignored that and looked at the board. “You set it up without me.”</p>
            <p>“You’re predictable now.”</p>
            <p>Her eyes narrowed. “That sounds like an insult.”</p>
            <p>“It’s not.”</p>
            <p>“Then what is it?”</p>
            <p>He shrugged. “Just an observation.”</p>
            <p>She moved a pawn forward. “You say that like you’re studying me.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe I am.”</p>
            <p>She froze for a fraction of a second, then forced herself to keep playing. “Well,” she said lightly, “I hope you’re taking good notes.”</p>
            <p>He didn’t answer. But there was that faint smile again.</p>
            <p>Their games began to last longer. Elena started recognizing patterns. She knew which moves would get her into trouble, and which ones gave her a fighting chance. Adrian stopped explaining every single step and only spoke when she made a serious mistake. “You’re thinking too far ahead,” he said once.</p>
            <p>“Isn’t that the point of chess?”</p>
            <p>“Yes. But not five moves ahead when you can’t see two clearly.”</p>
            <p>She leaned back, crossing her arms. “You always say things like that.”</p>
            <p>“Like what?”</p>
            <p>“Like you’re not just talking about chess.”</p>
            <p>He met her gaze calmly. “Maybe I’m not.”</p>
            <p>She held his eyes for a second, then looked away, pretending to study the board. Her heartbeat felt slightly faster than usual.</p>
            <p>Between moves, they started talking more. Not deep conversations yet. Just small things. What lectures they liked. Which lecturers were unnecessarily strict. Which cafeteria had the best samosas.</p>
            <p>“Engineering students always look tired,” she observed one day.</p>
            <p>“We are tired.”</p>
            <p>“Why?”</p>
            <p>“Because we build things that collapse if we get one number wrong.”</p>
            <p>She smirked. “Law students just argue about things that already collapsed.”</p>
            <p>“That sounds easier.”</p>
            <p>“It’s not. We have to pretend we care about every side of the argument.”</p>
            <p>“You don’t?”</p>
            <p>“Not always.”</p>
            <p>He tilted his head. “That’s concerning.”</p>
            <p>She laughed. “Don’t worry. I’ll care when it matters.”</p>
            <p>One afternoon, rain started unexpectedly. Students scattered, running toward covered walkways and lecture halls. The courtyard emptied in seconds, the sound of rain hitting the pavement replacing the usual chatter. Elena pulled her bag closer to her chest. “We should go,” she said.</p>
            <p>Adrian looked up at the sky, then at the board. “It’ll pass.”</p>
            <p>“You don’t know that.”</p>
            <p>He moved a knight. “You’re stalling.”</p>
            <p>She stared at him. “It’s raining.”</p>
            <p>“And you’re losing.”</p>
            <p>Her mouth fell open. “That is not the point.”</p>
            <p>He looked completely unbothered by the rain beginning to soak the edges of the table. She sighed and made her move. “You’re impossible,” she muttered.</p>
            <p>“You keep coming back.”</p>
            <p>She didn’t have an answer to that.</p>
            <p>By the third week, something had changed. They weren’t just playing chess anymore. They had routines. She would arrive, drop her bag on the same bench, and complain about one thing that had annoyed her that day. He would listen, occasionally offering a quiet comment or a dry observation that made her laugh. He started bringing an extra bottle of water. She started bringing snacks “by accident” and sharing them.</p>
            <p>“You planned this,” he said one afternoon, looking at the packet of biscuits she placed on the table.</p>
            <p>“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p>
            <p>“You always bring something on Thursdays.”</p>
            <p>“That’s just good timing.”</p>
            <p>He looked unconvinced. She slid the packet toward him. “Are you going to eat it or interrogate it?”</p>
            <p>He took one. “Thank you.”</p>
            <p>“You’re welcome.”</p>
            <p>The exchange felt small. Ordinary. But to Elena, it felt like a secret language forming between them—one made of gestures instead of words.</p>
            <p>One evening, the courtyard was nearly empty by the time they finished playing. The sun was low, turning the sky into soft shades of orange and gold. Long shadows stretched across the pavement. Elena realized she had been sitting there for almost two hours. “I should go,” she said, though she didn’t move.</p>
            <p>“Probably,” Adrian agreed. Neither of them stood up.</p>
            <p>She looked at the board. “I almost had you this time.”</p>
            <p>“Almost,” he said.</p>
            <p>She sighed. “I’m starting to hate that word.”</p>
            <p>“Why?”</p>
            <p>“Because it means you were close… but not enough.”</p>
            <p>He considered that. “Almost still means progress.”</p>
            <p>“Not in real life,” she said. “In real life, almost usually just means you lost.”</p>
            <p>He didn’t respond immediately. Then, quietly, he said, “Not always.”</p>
            <p>She looked at him. For a moment, the air between them felt heavier. Not uncomfortable. Just full of something neither of them could quite name yet. She stood up first. “Same time tomorrow?” she asked before she could stop herself.</p>
            <p>He nodded. “Same time.”</p>
            <p class="reflection" style="margin-top: 50px;">I didn’t realize we had built a world of our own. Not a big one. Not a dramatic one. Just a table under a tree. A chessboard. A few shared snacks. Long conversations that didn’t feel long. We didn’t call it anything. We didn’t define it. But it was ours. And the strange thing about private worlds is this: You never notice how fragile they are… until the first crack appears.</p>
