        <p class="book-title">If We Begin Again</p>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>The message came three days after the café encounter. Not late at night. Not impulsive. Early evening. Thoughtful timing.</p>
            
            <p><em>Adrian: Can we talk? Properly this time.</em></p>
            
            <p>Elena stared at the screen for a long moment. Her pulse didn’t spike the way it used to. But something steadier moved beneath her ribs. Not fear. Not hope. Something closer to readiness. She didn’t respond immediately. Growth, she had learned, sometimes looks like taking your time. An hour later, she typed:</p>
            
            <p><em>Elena: Okay. When?</em></p>

            <p>They met again at the chess table. It felt intentional now. The board was open this time. Pieces already arranged. White facing black. Elena noticed that detail immediately.</p>
            
            <p>“You set it up,” she said quietly.</p>
            
            <p>He nodded. “I figured we should at least finish a game properly.”</p>
            
            <p>A faint smile touched her lips. “Who’s white?”</p>
            
            <p>“You,” he said without hesitation. She didn’t miss the symbolism.</p>

            <p>They sat. The air felt different than the night everything ended. Less fragile. More honest. She moved first—sliding a pawn forward.</p>
            
            <p>“I’ve been doing a lot of thinking,” he said.</p>
            
            <p>She raised an eyebrow lightly. “That phrase didn’t work out well for me last time.”</p>
            
            <p>“I know,” he said, almost smiling. “But this isn’t the same kind of thinking.” She waited. “I was scared,” he said plainly. She didn’t interrupt. “I told myself I wasn’t ready. That I needed space. That I was protecting both of us.” He exhaled. “But the truth is, I was afraid of how much you mattered.”</p>
            
            <p>Her hand paused above a knight. He continued. “You were steady. Certain. You knew how you felt. And I… I didn’t know how to hold something that real without feeling overwhelmed.”</p>
            
            <p>Elena finally moved her piece. A measured, deliberate shift. “You could have told me that,” she said softly.</p>
            
            <p>“I know.”</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">There’s something disarming about hearing the truth you once begged for. It doesn’t arrive as triumph. It doesn’t feel like victory. It feels like confirmation. Like the missing sentence finally inserted into a story that once felt incomplete. He wasn’t confused. He was afraid. And I wasn’t too much. I was just clear.</p>

            <p>“I don’t expect you to just…” he searched for the right words. “Open the door again.”</p>
            
            <p>“I won’t,” she said calmly.</p>
            
            <p>He nodded. “Fair.”</p>
            
            <p>She leaned back slightly. “What’s different now?” she asked.</p>
            
            <p>He didn’t rush his answer. “I stopped pretending that distance would make things easier,” he said. “It didn’t. It just made it obvious that what we had mattered. And that I let fear make decisions for me.”</p>
            
            <p>“And now?”</p>
            
            <p>“Now I’d rather be scared and try than be safe and wonder.”</p>
            
            <p>The honesty landed softly between them. No grand speeches. No desperate promises. Just clarity.</p>

            <p>She studied him carefully. He looked the same. But not entirely. There was less defensiveness in his posture. Less retreat.</p>
            
            <p>“Trying,” she repeated. “Looks like what?”</p>
            
            <p>“Intentionality,” he said. “Not disappearing when things feel intense. Communicating instead of withdrawing. Choosing you out loud.”</p>
            
            <p>The last sentence held weight. <em>Choosing you. Out loud.</em></p>

            <p>She moved another piece. Check. He blinked, then laughed quietly. “You’ve gotten better.”</p>
            
            <p>“So have you,” she replied.</p>
            
            <p>He met her gaze. There it was. Not hesitation. Presence.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">This is the part no one talks about. The moment after growth. When the person who once hurt you stands in front of you—different, but familiar. Do you protect the version of yourself who survived? Or do you trust the version of yourself who evolved? I don’t want the old almost. I don’t want uncertainty dressed up as patience. If we begin again, it has to be with two people who know what they’re risking and choose it anyway.</p>

            <p>She exhaled slowly. “I’m not interested in going backward,” she said.</p>
            
            <p>“Neither am I.”</p>
            
            <p>“If we do this again, it’s not undefined. It’s not half-formed. It’s not one of us leaning while the other calculates.”</p>
            
            <p>He nodded. “Agreed.”</p>
            
            <p>She searched his face one last time for doubt. She didn’t find it. Just nervousness. And resolve.</p>
            
            <p>“Okay,” she said quietly. Not the fragile okay from the night he ended things. A different one. Steadier. Intentional. “We can try,” she added. “But this time, we both show up.”</p>
            
            <p>A small, almost disbelieving smile crossed his face. “I can do that.”</p>
            
            <p>She tilted her head slightly. “Don’t say it like a promise,” she said. “Say it like a decision.”</p>
            
            <p>He held her gaze. “I choose to show up.”</p>
            
            <p>Silence settled between them. But it wasn’t empty. It felt like a beginning.</p>

            <p>Outside, the campus moved as it always had. Students laughing. Footsteps crossing pathways. Life unfolding in ordinary ways. But at the chess table, something subtle shifted. Not fireworks. Not dramatic declarations. Just two people no longer hiding behind uncertainty. The game continued. And this time— neither of them was playing alone.</p>
