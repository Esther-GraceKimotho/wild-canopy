        <p class="book-title">The Conversation That Ended It</p>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>Sometimes, endings don’t arrive with shouting. No slammed doors. No accusations. No final dramatic words. Just a quiet sentence that lands heavier than anything loud ever could. And suddenly, everything you were holding has nowhere to go.</p>

            <p>The message came in the late afternoon. Elena was in the library, surrounded by open books she hadn’t really read. Her eyes moved across the pages, but her thoughts were somewhere else—circling the same questions they had been circling for weeks. Her phone buzzed softly against the table. She glanced at the screen.</p>
            
            <p><em>Adrian: Can we talk later?</em></p>
            
            <p>Her chest tightened instantly. Not because the message was alarming. But because of what it felt like. Formal. Careful. Like the beginning of something final. She stared at the screen for a long moment. Then typed:</p>
            
            <p><em>Elena: Okay.</em></p>

            <p>They met at the chess table that evening. The sky was pale and quiet, the kind of evening that didn’t hint at anything important happening. Students walked past them, laughing, arguing, living their ordinary lives. Adrian was already there. But the board was closed. That was the first sign. He didn’t look up immediately when she approached. His hands were clasped together on the table, fingers interlocked like he was trying to hold something in place.</p>
            
            <p>“Hey,” she said softly.</p>
            
            <p>“Hey.”</p>
            
            <p>She sat across from him. Neither of them opened the chessboard. The silence stretched.</p>
            
            <p>“What did you want to talk about?” she asked.</p>
            
            <p>He inhaled slowly, like someone about to step into cold water. “I’ve been thinking a lot lately,” he began.</p>
            
            <p>Her stomach twisted. “That’s usually not a good start,” she said, attempting a small smile.</p>
            
            <p>He didn’t smile back. “I don’t think I can give you what you want right now.”</p>
            
            <p>The words were calm. Measured. But they felt like a sharp edge pressing into her chest. She swallowed. “What do you mean?”</p>
            
            <p>“I mean… you deserve someone who’s sure. Someone who doesn’t hesitate like I do.”</p>
            
            <p>Her fingers curled slightly against the edge of the table. “That’s not really your decision to make for me.”</p>
            
            <p>“I know,” he said quietly. “But it’s my responsibility to be honest.”</p>
            
            <p><em>Honest.</em> That word again. Always so reasonable. So impossible to argue with. She looked at him carefully. “So what are you saying?”</p>
            
            <p>He hesitated. And in that hesitation, she already knew.</p>
            
            <p>“Maybe we should stop...  I need to take a step back,” he said.</p>
            
            <p>There it was. Not dramatic. Not cruel. Not even loud. Just a sentence. And suddenly, the air felt heavier.</p>

            <p>For a moment, she didn’t speak. She stared at the chessboard between them. Closed. Untouched. Like something that had quietly ended without a ceremony.</p>
            
            <p>“Stop what?” she asked, though she already knew the answer.</p>
            
            <p>“This… whatever we’ve been doing.”</p>
            
            <p>The words felt vague. Undefined. And yet, they carried the weight of everything. She nodded slowly, trying to stay composed.</p>
            
            <p>“Okay,” she said. The word tasted strange in her mouth.</p>
            
            <p>He looked surprised. “Okay?”</p>
            
            <p>“What do you want me to say?” she asked softly. “If that’s how you feel, I’m not going to force you to stay.”</p>
            
            <p>His shoulders dropped slightly, like he had been holding tension he didn’t even realize was there. “I’m sorry,” he said.</p>
            
            <p>She believed him. That was the worst part. He wasn’t cruel. He wasn’t careless. He wasn’t trying to hurt her. He just wasn’t choosing her.</p>

            <p>They sat in silence for a few seconds.</p>
            
            <p>“Can we still be friends?” he asked.</p>
            
            <p>She let out a quiet breath. “That depends,” she said.</p>
            
            <p>“On what?”</p>
            
            <p>“On whether I can look at you and not feel like I lost something.”</p>
            
            <p>He didn’t answer. Because there was nothing he could say to make that easier.</p>

            <p>She stood up first. “I should go,” she said.</p>
            
            <p>“Yeah.”</p>
            
            <p>She picked up her bag. For a moment, she considered hugging him. Or saying something meaningful. Or asking one last question. But none of it felt right. So she just nodded. “Take care, Adrian.”</p>
            
            <p>“You too, Elena.”</p>

            <p>As she walked away, she expected to feel something dramatic. Tears. Anger. Relief. Instead, she just felt… quiet. Like a room after everyone has left.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">He didn’t break my heart. He just stepped out of it. And maybe that’s the difference. A broken heart feels sharp. Sudden. Violent. But an empty heart? That feels like silence. Like a song that stopped playing and you didn’t even notice when it ended.</p>
