        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 8</h1>
        <p class="book-title">The Space Between Words</p>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>There was no real fight. No explosion. No single moment that could be pointed to and named as the beginning of the end. Just space. It crept in quietly, like dusk—so slowly she didn’t notice the light fading until the room was already dark.</p>

            <p>They still talked, but the rhythm had changed. Conversations that once lasted hours now ended after a few minutes. “Hey.” “Hey.” “What are you doing?” “Nothing much.” “Same.” “Okay, talk later.” “Yeah.” And that would be it. No laughter. No late-night confessions. No “Are you still awake?” messages at 1:13 a.m. Just polite endings. Neat, contained exchanges that felt like strangers trying not to be rude.</p>

            <p>She told herself it was normal. People got busy. People had lives. People didn’t stay in that early, glowing phase forever. But there was a difference between less and empty. And lately, everything felt empty.</p>

            <p>One night, she stared at her phone for nearly ten minutes before typing: <em>Are we okay?</em> She didn’t send it. Deleted it. Typed again: <em>You’ve been distant. Did I do something wrong?</em> Deleted that too. Finally, she settled for something small. Something safe. <em>Hey. How was your day?</em> He replied twenty minutes later. <em>It was okay. Busy.</em> That was all. No “How about you?” No question in return. She read the message again and again, searching for warmth that wasn’t there. It felt like knocking on a door and hearing footsteps on the other side… but no one opening it.</p>

            <p>In her journal that night, she wrote: <br>
            <span style="font-style: italic;">I don’t know when it changed. There was no moment, no argument, no mistake I can trace back to. Just this quiet drifting apart. And the worst part is, I don’t know if he notices. Or if he does, maybe he just doesn’t mind.</span><br>
            She paused, pen hovering. <br>
            <span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe I’m the only one still holding on to something that already let go of me.</span></p>

            <p>A few days later, they talked on the phone. The conversation was fine. Not bad. Not good. Just… fine. He laughed once, but it sounded distant, like it came from another room. There were more silences than usual. At one point, she realized she was talking just to fill the gaps, not because she had something to say. She told him about a random class incident. Then about a movie she’d watched. Then about a meme she’d seen. He responded with short acknowledgments. “Yeah.” “That’s funny.” “Oh, nice.” It felt like trying to light a fire with damp wood.</p>

            <p>After they hung up, she sat on her bed, staring at the blank wall. For the first time, a thought formed clearly in her mind: <em>What if this is how it ends?</em> Not with a fight. Not with betrayal. Not even with a clear goodbye. Just with two people slowly talking less and less until one day, they don’t talk at all.</p>

            <p>She hated that thought. So she did what she always did when something scared her. She tried harder. She texted first. She called more often. She asked more questions. She matched his silence with effort, hoping it would balance the scale. But love didn’t work like equations. The more she reached, the more she felt how far away he already was.</p>

            <p>One evening, she typed: <em>I miss how we used to talk.</em> Her finger hovered over the send button. For a long time. Then she locked her phone and set it down. Some words felt too heavy to send. Like, once they left her screen, they’d change everything. And she wasn’t sure she was ready for the answer.</p>

            <p>That night, she wrote one last line in her journal: <br>
            <span style="font-style: italic;">There’s a distance growing between us. Not measured in kilometers or minutes, but in words we’re no longer saying.</span> <br>
            And for the first time, she wondered if love could fade quietly, without either of them meaning for it to. Just a slow, gentle unraveling— like a knot loosening itself in the dark.</p>
