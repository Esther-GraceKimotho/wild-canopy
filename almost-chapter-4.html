        <p class="book-title">Evenings That Last Too Long</p>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>I didn’t notice the exact moment things changed. There was no argument. No cold words. No sudden distance that you could point to and say, there, that’s where it broke. It was softer than that. A reply that came an hour later than usual. A conversation that ended sooner than it should have. A smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. If love begins in small moments, then so does loss. And sometimes, the most dangerous change is the one you can’t quite prove is real.</p>

            <p>The evenings were the best part of Elena’s day. Not the lectures. Not the tutorials. Not the endless readings that made her eyes ache by midnight. Just those quiet hours at the chess table, when the courtyard slowly emptied and the world felt smaller, softer, more manageable. It had become routine without either of them ever calling it that. By late afternoon, she would find herself glancing at the clock more often. Packing her books a little earlier. Taking the path that led past the jacaranda tree, even when she could have taken a shorter route. And most days, he was already there.</p>
            
            <p>That evening, though, he wasn’t. Elena slowed as she approached the table. The chessboard sat alone, half-covered in fallen blossoms. No extra bottle of water. No notebook. No quiet boy leaning forward in concentration. Just an empty chair. She frowned slightly and checked the time. She wasn’t early. If anything, she was a few minutes late. Maybe he had a lecture. Or a lab. Engineering students always seemed to have something. She sat down anyway. The courtyard buzzed around her. A group of students passed, laughing loudly. Someone dragged a chair across the pavement with a screeching sound that made her wince.</p>
            
            <p>She pulled out her phone. No new messages. She locked the screen again. It didn’t mean anything. People got busy. He wasn’t obligated to sit at a chess table every afternoon just because she had gotten used to it. Still, she stayed. Five minutes passed. Then ten. She opened her file, pretending to read. The words blurred together. Something about contract formation. Offer, acceptance, intention to create legal relations. Her phone buzzed. Her heart reacted before her mind did. She pulled it out quickly.</p>
            
            <p><em>Adrian: Sorry. Lab ran late. I’m still on the other side of campus.</em></p>
            
            <p>She stared at the message for a moment. No explanation. No "Are you at the table?" No "I’ll be there soon." Just information. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard. <em>It’s okay.</em> Delete. <em>No problem.</em> Delete. <em>I’m at the table.</em> Delete. She locked the phone and set it down on the table. She didn’t want to sound like she had been waiting. Another minute passed before she picked it up again.</p>
            
            <p><em>Elena: No worries.</em></p>
            
            <p>She stared at the message after sending it, suddenly wishing she had added something warmer. Or maybe something cooler. Something that didn’t reveal too much. But it was too late now. Three dots appeared almost immediately.</p>
            
            <p><em>Adrian: I’ll see you tomorrow.</em></p>
            
            <p>That was all. She read the message twice. Then a third time. Her chest felt oddly tight. <em>I’ll see you tomorrow.</em> Not: Are you still there? Not: Wait for me. Not even: Sorry again. Just tomorrow. She locked her phone and slipped it back into her bag. The courtyard suddenly felt louder than usual. She packed her things slowly and stood up. As she walked away from the table, she told herself it didn’t matter. It was one evening. One missed game. People had lives.</p>

            <p>The next day, he was there again. Same seat. Same calm expression. Same board. "Hey," he said when she approached. "Hi." She sat down, trying to act normal. "Lab was exhausting yesterday," he said. "We were there for almost four hours." She nodded. "Sounds intense." "It was." He rotated the board toward her. "White again?" "Yeah." She moved a pawn forward. One square. He noticed. "You’ve become cautious," he said. "I’m adapting."</p>
            
            <p>He didn’t respond, just made his move. For a while, the conversation felt normal. They talked about lecturers, assignments, and a campus event happening the following week. But something felt slightly... off. He checked his phone more often. He responded, but sometimes after a pause. His attention drifted. "You’re distracted," she said after he missed an obvious move. He looked up. "Am I?" "Yes. You would’ve taken that piece ten minutes ago." He glanced at the board, then at her. "Maybe I’m just tired." She nodded, but the answer didn’t fully settle her.</p>

            <p>That night, she found herself thinking about the message again. <em>I’ll see you tomorrow.</em> It wasn’t rude. It wasn’t cold. Just... neutral. She picked up her phone and opened their conversation. The earlier messages were still there. Short exchanges. Small jokes. A few shared observations about campus life. Nothing dramatic. Nothing romantic. And yet, she had grown used to them. She typed: <em>Did you eat?</em> Then stared at it. It felt too personal. Too unnecessary. She deleted it. She placed the phone on her bedside table and turned off the light.</p>
            
            <p>Five minutes later, she picked it up again. Still nothing. She told herself she was being ridiculous. People didn’t owe each other constant messages. They weren’t even... anything. Just friends. Just chess partners. Just two people who happened to sit at the same table every afternoon. So why did the silence feel different now?</p>

            <p>Over the next few days, the pattern continued. He still came to the table. They still played. They still talked. But the rhythm had shifted. Sometimes he arrived late. Sometimes he left earlier than usual. Sometimes his replies were shorter. And Elena found herself noticing every small change. One afternoon, she checked her phone in the middle of a lecture. No message. She told herself not to look again. Ten minutes later, she looked anyway. Still nothing. She closed her notebook and stared at the lecturer, trying to focus. Words floated past her without meaning.</p>
            
            <p>By the time the lecture ended, her phone buzzed. <em>Adrian: Sorry. Busy day.</em> Her chest tightened in a way she didn’t fully understand. Not anger. Something softer. And heavier. Fear. Not loud. Not overwhelming. Just a quiet thought she couldn’t ignore: What if he’s already stepping back?</p>

            <p>That evening at the chess table, she tried something new. She decided she would match his energy. If he was distant, she would be casual. If he was quiet, she would be quiet too. No overthinking. No long conversations. No extra warmth. Just balance. He arrived five minutes late. "Sorry," he said. "Group meeting ran over time." "It’s fine," she replied, keeping her tone light.</p>
            
            <p>They started playing. He spoke less than usual. So did she. The silence between them felt different this time. Not comfortable. Just... unfinished. Her phone buzzed on the table. A message from a classmate. She didn’t check it. He noticed. "You can answer that," he said. "It’s nothing important." He nodded and made his move. She stared at the board, suddenly aware of how hard she was trying to appear unaffected. She moved a piece. He captured it immediately. "You’re distracted," he said. "I’m not." He looked at her carefully, like he was trying to decide whether to believe her. She forced a small smile. "Your move."</p>
            
            <p>But inside, something felt unsteady. Matching his energy was harder than she thought. Because every time he spoke, her heart still reacted the same way. And every time he went quiet, she felt the absence like a missing step on a staircase.</p>
            
            <p style="font-style: italic;">I told myself I would match his energy. If he replied hours later, I would do the same. If he sounded distant, I would sound casual too. If he pulled back, I would give him space. It sounded easy in theory. But every time his message came in, my heart still reacted the same way. And I would answer too quickly. Too warmly. Too honest. That was the problem. He could pretend nothing was changing. I couldn’t.</p>
