        <p class="book-title">The Question She Couldn’t Swallow</p>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>There comes a moment in every almost-love when silence becomes heavier than truth. Elena felt it building for weeks. Not dramatic. Not explosive. Just a pressure behind her ribs that wouldn’t dissolve.</p>

            <p>They still met. Still played chess. Still walked side by side across campus. But the warmth had thinned. It was like standing near a fire that was technically still burning— yet no longer capable of keeping you warm. That afternoon, the sky was pale and undecided. Clouds hovered without committing to rain. They sat across from each other, the board between them. He was quieter than usual. Focused. Detached. She watched his hands instead of the pieces. The way his fingers hovered before moving. The precision. The hesitation.</p>
            
            <p>“You’ve been thinking a lot lately,” she said.</p>
            
            <p>He didn’t look up. “I usually do.”</p>
            
            <p>“No,” she replied softly. “I mean… more than usual.”</p>
            
            <p>He moved his bishop. “About what?”</p>
            
            <p>She swallowed. <em>About us.</em> But she didn’t say it. “I don’t know,” she murmured. “You just feel… elsewhere.”</p>
            
            <p>He finally looked at her. And for a split second, she saw it. Not indifference. Not cruelty. Fear. “I’ve just been busy,” he said again. The same answer. Worn thin from repetition.</p>

            <p>That night, she didn’t journal. She didn’t cry. She didn’t overanalyze. She simply lay in bed staring at the ceiling, aware that something inside her had reached its limit. You can only pretend not to notice distance for so long. Eventually, it starts to feel like lying to yourself.</p>

            <p>Two days later, she asked him to walk with her after class. Not to the chess table. Not to the cafeteria. Just to walk. He agreed. They moved slowly across campus paths scattered with dry leaves. Neither spoke at first. The quiet between them felt intentional now. Not comfortable. Not accidental. Deliberate.</p>
            
            <p>“I need to ask you something,” she said finally.</p>
            
            <p>He nodded. “Okay.”</p>
            
            <p>Her pulse quickened. She had rehearsed this in her head dozens of times. But the words felt different out loud. “Do you still… want this?”</p>
            
            <p>He didn’t answer immediately. And that silence—that single, suspended pause—told her more than any sentence could have. “What do you mean?” he asked carefully.</p>
            
            <p>She exhaled. “This. Us. Whatever we’ve been doing.”</p>
            
            <p>He looked ahead, not at her. “I don’t know what we’ve been doing.”</p>
            
            <p>The honesty struck her like cold air. “That’s the problem,” she said quietly.</p>
            
            <p>They stopped walking. Students passed around them, laughing, unaware that something fragile was cracking in real time. “I care about you,” he said.</p>
            
            <p>“I know.”</p>
            
            <p>“But I don’t know if I’m in the space to… commit to something.”</p>
            
            <p>The word lingered. <em>Commit.</em> As if love were a contract he hadn’t agreed to sign. She nodded slowly. “I’m not asking for forever.”</p>
            
            <p>He glanced at her then.</p>
            
            <p>“I’m asking if you see me as something real. Or just… convenient.”</p>
            
            <p>His jaw tightened slightly. “That’s not fair.”</p>
            
            <p>“Then help me understand,” she replied, voice steady but soft. “I feel like I’m always leaning forward. And you’re always… stepping back.”</p>
            
            <p>He ran a hand through his hair. “I just don’t want to rush into something I’m not ready for.”</p>
            
            <p>“And I don’t want to stay in something that feels uncertain,” she said. There it was. The truth. Not dramatic. Not cruel. Just incompatible needs standing face-to-face.</p>

            <p>They resumed walking, slower now. “I never meant to hurt you,” he said.</p>
            
            <p>“I know.”</p>
            
            <p>“And I’m not pushing you away.”</p>
            
            <p>She stopped again. “But you’re not pulling me closer either.” He didn’t deny it.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">That was the moment I understood something I didn’t want to understand. He wasn’t confused. He wasn’t unaware. He just wasn’t certain enough. And love—real love—doesn’t hover in uncertainty for long. It chooses. Or it releases.</p>

            <p>They reached the edge of campus. The sky finally decided to rain. Soft at first. Then steady. He looked at her, rain catching in his hair. “I don’t want to lose you.”</p>
            
            <p>The words almost broke her. Because she believed him. But she also understood what he wasn’t saying. <em>You cannot want to lose someone and still not fight hard enough to keep them.</em></p>
            
            <p>“I don’t want to lose you either,” she replied. “And that’s why this hurts.”</p>
            
            <p>They stood there, soaked and suspended. Neither stepping forward. Neither stepping away. Just two people realizing that wanting each other wasn’t the same as being ready.</p>

            <p>That night, she didn’t text him. He didn’t text her either. And for the first time, the silence didn’t feel confusing. It felt like a countdown. Something inevitable approaching. Something they had both seen coming but never dared to name. Until now.</p>
