        <p class="book-title">The Shape of A Future</p>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>I didn’t sleep much that night. Not because of the argument. Not even because of the internship. But because of what it made me realize. For a long time, I thought my life would be something I built alone. Career first. Stability. Control. Love, if it came, would just… fit into the edges. Something soft. Something optional. But when Elena said she might leave for six months, something in me shifted. Not panic. Not jealousy. Just a quiet, terrifying clarity. When I imagined my future, she was there. Not as an accessory. Not as a temporary chapter. But as someone woven into the structure of it. And that realization felt heavier than any argument.</p>

            <p>The next day, I found myself at the chess table again. Our table. The one where everything started. I set up the board without thinking. White facing black. She was always white. Not because she won more. But because she moved first. In conversations. In emotions. In honesty. She was braver than I was. At least at the beginning.</p>

            <p>I used to think love was something that happened suddenly. A moment. A confession. A dramatic turning point. But for me, it didn’t feel like that. It felt like a slow realization. Like noticing the same person in all your future memories. Graduation photos. First apartments. Late-night arguments about bills. Lazy Sunday mornings. Big decisions. Small routines. Every version of the future I imagined— she was there. And the thought of building all of that without her felt wrong. Like a house missing its foundation.</p>

            <p>The truth is, I’ve always been afraid of permanence. Of promises. Of anything that sounded like “forever.” Forever felt like a trap. Like something that would eventually turn into disappointment. But when I thought about forever with her, it didn’t feel like a trap. It felt like direction. Like a path instead of a cage.</p>

            <p>I heard footsteps behind me. I didn’t have to turn around to know it was her. “You always get here before me,” she said. I smiled slightly. “Old habits.” She sat across from me. Neither of us moved the pieces. Not yet.</p>

            <p>“I’ve been thinking about what you said yesterday,” I told her. She nodded slowly. “Me too.” “I don’t want you to stay back,” I said. “And I don’t want to be the reason you shrink your world.” She watched me carefully. “But I also don’t want to pretend it doesn’t scare me,” I continued. “Because it does.” “That’s fair,” she said softly. I exhaled. “I realized something last night,” I said. Her expression shifted slightly. “Yeah?” “Every time I think about the future… you’re in it.” The words felt simple. But they carried more weight than anything I’d said before. She didn’t speak. So I continued. “I don’t just want to be someone you date in university. Or someone you remember as almost. I want to build something real with you. Something that lasts beyond internships and distance and whatever comes next.” Her eyes softened. “And you’re only realizing this now?” she asked gently. I laughed quietly. “I’m slow with important things.”</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">This is the part that scares me. Not losing her. But admitting how much she means to me. Because once you say it out loud, you can’t pretend it’s casual anymore. You can’t hide behind uncertainty. You have to show up. Every day.</p>

            <p>“I don’t know what the next few years will look like,” I said. “But I know I want you in them. Not just for now. For real.” She swallowed, emotion flickering across her face. “That sounds a lot like a promise,” she said. “It’s more like a decision,” I replied. “One I plan to keep making.”</p>

            <p>She reached across the table and moved a pawn forward. White, as always. “Then we’ll figure the rest out,” she said. I smiled. “Together?” She nodded. “Together.”</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">Maybe love isn’t about knowing exactly how everything will work. Maybe it’s just about knowing who you want beside you while you figure it out. And for the first time, that answer feels simple. It’s her. And if the future is a long, uncertain road, then I don’t want to walk it alone anymore. I want to walk it with Elena.</p>
