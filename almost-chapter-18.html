        <p class="book-title">The Day It Felt Easy</p>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>It was a Saturday. No classes. No deadlines hovering over their heads. No urgent messages or emotional conversations waiting to happen. Just a quiet, ordinary morning. Elena woke up to sunlight spilling across her pillow and the distant sound of someone laughing in the corridor outside her room. She stretched, checked her phone, and saw a message from Adrian.</p>
            
            <p><em>Adrian: Coffee?</em></p>
            
            <p>No explanation. No overthinking. Just coffee. She smiled and replied:</p>
            
            <p><em>Elena: Give me twenty minutes.</em></p>

            <p>They met at the small campus café near the engineering block. It wasn’t their usual spot. No chessboard. No heavy symbolism. Just a small round table by the window. Adrian was already there, two cups sitting between his hands.</p>
            
            <p>“You guessed my order?” she asked as she sat down.</p>
            
            <p>He shrugged. “You always get the same thing.”</p>
            
            <p>She raised an eyebrow. “You’ve been paying attention.”</p>
            
            <p>“Trying to,” he said.</p>
            
            <p>She took a sip. He was right.</p>

            <p>They didn’t talk about feelings. They didn’t talk about the past. They talked about a ridiculous lecturer who mispronounced half the class list. About a group project that was already falling apart. About a stray cat that had apparently started living near the library steps. At one point, he described how the cat had chased a pigeon twice its size and lost. Elena laughed—really laughed. The kind that made her lean forward and cover her mouth. He watched her for a moment, smiling.</p>
            
            <p>“What?” she asked.</p>
            
            <p>“Nothing,” he said. “I just missed that.”</p>
            
            <p>“Missed what?”</p>
            
            <p>“That sound.”</p>
            
            <p>She felt warmth spread through her chest.</p>

            <p>After coffee, they walked without a destination. Past the library. Across the football field. Through the quieter side paths of campus where fewer people passed. At one point, their hands brushed. Neither of them made a big deal out of it. But neither of them pulled away, either.</p>

            <p>They ended up sitting on the low concrete wall near the old science block. From there, they could see most of the campus stretching out below. Students scattered across the grass. Someone playing music softly from a speaker. Two people arguing over what looked like a chess game on a portable board. Elena noticed it immediately. He followed her gaze.</p>
            
            <p>“Should we go challenge them?” he asked.</p>
            
            <p>She smiled. “Let them have their moment.”</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">This is what I used to imagine love would feel like. Not the intense parts. Not the late-night confessions or the almost-breakups. Just this. Sunlight. Coffee. Unimportant conversations that somehow feel important because of who you’re having them with. It’s strange how peace can feel unfamiliar when you’ve gotten used to uncertainty. Part of me keeps waiting for something to go wrong. But another part—quieter, steadier— is starting to believe this might actually last.</p>

            <p>“Can I ask you something?” he said.</p>
            
            <p>She nodded.</p>
            
            <p>“When did you stop being angry at me?”</p>
            
            <p>She considered the question. “I don’t think I was ever really angry,” she said. “Just hurt.”</p>
            
            <p>“And when did that change?”</p>
            
            <p>She looked out across the campus. “When I realized the story wasn’t just about you pulling away,” she said. “It was about me learning what I needed, too.”</p>
            
            <p>He nodded slowly. “That makes sense.”</p>
            
            <p>She turned back to him. “And you?”</p>
            
            <p>“What about me?”</p>
            
            <p>“When did you stop being scared?”</p>
            
            <p>He let out a quiet breath. “I don’t think I stopped,” he admitted. “I just decided that being scared wasn’t a good enough reason to lose something real.”</p>
            
            <p>She smiled softly. “That’s a better answer than pretending you’re fearless.”</p>

            <p>They sat there for a while, not saying much. Just watching the campus move. At some point, he leaned back on his hands, face tilted toward the sky.</p>
            
            <p>“This feels… normal,” he said.</p>
            
            <p>“Is that a good thing?” she asked.</p>
            
            <p>He turned his head toward her. “Yeah,” he said. “I think it is.”</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">Maybe love isn’t supposed to feel like a storm. Maybe it’s supposed to feel like this— A calm afternoon. A shared cup of coffee. A conversation about nothing. And the quiet realization that nothing is exactly where you want to be.</p>

            <p>As the sun began to dip lower, they stood up to leave.</p>
            
            <p>“Same time next Saturday?” he asked lightly.</p>
            
            <p>She smirked. “Didn’t I say not to turn this into a schedule?”</p>
            
            <p>He laughed. “Right. Right.”</p>
            
            <p>They walked back toward the dorms. At the corner where their paths split, he stopped.</p>
            
            <p>“So… I’ll see you tomorrow?” he said.</p>
            
            <p>She nodded. “You will.”</p>
            
            <p>No promises. No dramatic goodbyes. Just certainty in small words. And this time, certainty felt easy.</p>
