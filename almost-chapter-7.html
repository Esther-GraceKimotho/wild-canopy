        <p class="book-title">Trying To Match The Distance</p>

        <div class="story-text">
            <p>There’s a quiet humiliation in loving someone more loudly than they love you. Not because they’re cruel. Not because they’ve promised anything they didn’t deliver. But because you can feel the imbalance. You start adjusting yourself. You speak less. You wait longer. You pretend you don’t care about things that keep you awake at night. You tell yourself it’s maturity. But sometimes, it’s just fear.</p>

            <p>Elena decided she would change. Not dramatically. Not in a way he could accuse her of. Just subtly. She would stop initiating conversations every evening. She would stop arriving early to the chess table. She would stop offering pieces of herself so easily. If he could be measured, she could be measured too. The next afternoon, she arrived exactly on time. Not early. Not late. He was already there.</p>
            
            <p>“You’re punctual today,” he observed lightly.</p>
            
            <p>“I usually am.”</p>
            
            <p>He smiled faintly. “You’re usually early.”</p>
            
            <p>She shrugged as she sat down. “Schedules change.”</p>
            
            <p>Something unreadable passed across his face. They started playing. She kept her tone even. Calm. Detached. When he asked about her day, she answered briefly. “Fine.” “Busy.” “Nothing special.” No long stories about lecturers. No exaggerated complaints. No animated retellings. He noticed.</p>
            
            <p>“You’re quiet,” he said after a few moves.</p>
            
            <p>“You said I talk too much.”</p>
            
            <p>“I didn’t say that.”</p>
            
            <p>“You implied it.”</p>
            
            <p>He leaned back slightly. “I don’t think I did.”</p>
            
            <p>She moved her rook. “Well, I’m just… protecting myself.” The words slipped out before she could soften them. He looked at her more carefully now.</p>
            
            <p>“From what?”</p>
            
            <p><em>From you.</em> She almost said it. Instead, she looked down at the board. “Nothing.”</p>

            <p>That night, she didn’t message him. Her phone felt heavier than usual. She placed it face down on her desk and focused on her reading. By 10:15 p.m., there was still no notification. Her chest tightened. By 11:02 p.m., she had checked her screen at least six times. Still nothing. She told herself this was good. This was what balance looked like. Two people living their own lives. Not clinging. Not orbiting each other.</p>
            
            <p>At 11:47 p.m., her phone buzzed. Her heart betrayed her again.</p>
            
            <p><em>Adrian: You alive?</em></p>
            
            <p>She stared at the message. Three words. Casual. Almost playful. Relief washed through her before she could stop it. She forced herself to wait. Five minutes. Ten. At twelve minutes, she unlocked her phone.</p>
            
            <p><em>Elena: Yes.</em></p>
            
            <p>She considered adding more. <em>Just studying.</em> Delete. <em>Why?</em> Delete. Just yes. He replied quickly.</p>
            
            <p><em>Adrian: You’ve been distant.</em></p>
            
            <p>Her breath caught. Distant. The irony made her chest ache.</p>
            
            <p><em>Elena: Have I?</em></p>
            
            <p>The typing dots appeared almost immediately.</p>
            
            <p><em>Adrian: Yeah. A little.</em></p>
            
            <p>She stared at the screen. She wanted to laugh. She wanted to cry. She had been bending herself into a shape that matched his distance, and now he was noticing the gap. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard. <em>I’m just matching your energy.</em> Delete. <em>You’ve been different, too.</em> Delete. Instead:</p>
            
            <p><em>Elena: Just busy.</em></p>
            
            <p>The safest answer. He responded a few seconds later.</p>
            
            <p><em>Adrian: Okay.</em></p>
            
            <p>Just that. Okay. The conversation ended there.</p>

            <p>The next day at the chess table felt strained. Not hostile. Just aware. They were both conscious of something unspoken. He made a risky move, sacrificing his knight.</p>
            
            <p>“You’re playing differently,” she said.</p>
            
            <p>“Trying something new.”</p>
            
            <p>“Why?”</p>
            
            <p>He met her eyes. “Sometimes you have to shift strategy.”</p>
            
            <p>The words landed between them like a mirror. She looked down at the board. “And if it fails?”</p>
            
            <p>He shrugged. “Then you adjust again.”</p>
            
            <p>She swallowed. “And if you lose something important in the process?”</p>
            
            <p>His jaw tightened slightly. “That’s the risk.”</p>

            <p>As the days passed, the pattern deepened. She matched his delayed replies. He noticed and reached out. She softened. He pulled back again. It became a quiet dance. Neither of them naming what they were doing. Neither of them fully stepping forward.</p>
            
            <p>One evening, as they packed up the chess pieces, she asked softly: “Do you ever feel like we’re trying too hard to act normal?”</p>
            
            <p>He paused, a pawn still in his hand. “Maybe.”</p>
            
            <p>“Why?”</p>
            
            <p>He placed the pawn back in the box carefully. “Because if we don’t act normal, then we’d have to define what this is.”</p>
            
            <p>Her heart pounded. “And what if we did?” she asked.</p>
            
            <p>He didn’t answer immediately. Rainclouds gathered in the distance, the sky darkening slowly above them. “I don’t know if I’m in a place to define anything right now,” he said finally.</p>
            
            <p>The words were not harsh. They were honest. And honesty can be devastating. She nodded, pretending she understood. “That’s fair.”</p>
            
            <p><em>Fair.</em> She hated that word. It sounded reasonable. Measured. Emotionally mature. It didn’t account for the way her chest felt like it was slowly being hollowed out.</p>

            <p>That night, she lay awake longer than usual. He wasn’t rejecting her. He wasn’t choosing someone else. He wasn’t disappearing completely. He just wasn’t stepping forward. And she was tired of being the one who leaned in first.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">I thought matching his distance would protect me. If I pulled back too, I wouldn’t feel the imbalance. If I waited longer to reply, I wouldn’t feel desperate. If I spoke less, I wouldn’t feel exposed. But the truth was simple: I didn’t want balance. I wanted certainty. And every time he said he wasn’t ready to define anything, I heard something else. I’m not ready to choose you.</p>
